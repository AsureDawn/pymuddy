*** Notice: Project renamed...repo moved to: https://github.com/AsureDawn/pymudder ***

pymuddy will be a mud client implementing the GMCP protocol

For the moment, I have the following implemented:
 * The skeleton for handling messages from the server

What I still need to do:
 * Implement the base mud client logic
    (is this hard? is there a base I can build on?)
 * Build the client request skeleton
 * Create functions that actually perform tasks with the data from the server
 * Create a UI (planning on using GTK/GtkBuilder)
 * Hook up the backend to the UI
 * Anything else I may have forgotten ;-)

I haven't decided on a license yet; I'm fairly flexible, though.
If you'd like to recommend one to me, just send me a mail. ^.^
